# System Patterns

## System Architecture

- The portfolio will be built using a modern web stack with a focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability.
- The architecture will follow a component-based design, leveraging Next.js's App Router for routing and dynamic rendering.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Use Next.js 14+ for its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- Tailwind CSS for consistent and efficient styling.
- Supabase for backend services, including data storage and authentication.
- Vercel for seamless deployment and hosting.

## Design Patterns

- Component-based architecture to ensure reusability and modularity.
- Responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Icon-based visual representation for enhanced user experience.

## Component Relationships

- The menu component will link to all major sections (Technologies, Experience, Projects, Training, About Me).
- Each section (e.g., Experience, Projects) will have its own dedicated component for encapsulating related data and functionality.
- Shared components (e.g., buttons, icons) will be used across multiple sections to maintain consistency.
